# 🗑 Smart Waste Segregation using EfficientNet + Custom CNN (Garbage Classification)

A deep learning project that classifies waste images into 6 recyclable categories using a hybrid CNN model built by fine-tuning EfficientNetV2B2 with custom Convolutional Neural Network layers. The project includes a web-based interface using Gradio with support for image upload and real-time webcam capture.

<p>
The visual above represents the complete training and evaluation pipeline. It uses EfficientNetV2B2 as a feature extractor, followed by custom CNN layers. The model is initially trained with a frozen base, then fine-tuned, and finally evaluated on multiple metrics like accuracy, loss curves, and confusion matrix.

</p

- **Left (Accuracy):** Training accuracy steadily improves and validation accuracy stabilizes above **95%**, indicating effective learning and generalization.
- **Right (Loss):** Both training and validation loss decrease rapidly and flatten out, showing that the model is converging without overfitting.

  <img src="https://github.com/Salaar-Saaiem/Garbage-Classification-using-ML/blob/main/Assets/confusion_matrix.jpg" alt="Confusion Matrix" width="700"/>
</p

- High diagonal values (true positives) indicate strong classification accuracy across all six categories: **cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic, trash**.
- Minimal confusion is observed between similar classes (e.g., glass and metal).
- Especially strong results for **paper** and **plastic**, with 53 and 46 correct predictions respectively.
